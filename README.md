# ðŸŽ® Isabela Ramos

I am a psychologist, with a postgraduate degree in education. Currently, I work as a customer success assistant at a company specializing in game design courses. My current role has inspired me to start my studies in technology and programming. 

I have experience as a scientific researcher and in applying the agile Scrum methodology.

I have a deep appreciation for narratives in various forms, including books, music, and movies. However, my primary hobby is gaming, which I adore! From digital games to tabletop RPG and board games.
